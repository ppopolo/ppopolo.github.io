<div id="MyVoice App"><h3>MyVoice - Voice Recorder and Self-Rating Log</h3>

<p class="summary">

<p>There is a need for persons receiving voice therapy to keep track of voice quality each day between therapy sessions. With this app users can self-rate their voice and log their ratings daily, using a protocol adapted from the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association (NSDA).</p> 

<p>The app is also designed to allow users to easily record voice samples each day. The recordings and self-ratings log file can be sent to your email account using a built-in send email feature, to access them by computer.</p>

<p>Additional features and functionality include the ability to set and store a daily reminder to start a session,  and a spreadsheet view of the log file of all your stored  results.</p>
