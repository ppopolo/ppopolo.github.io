<p style="text-align:justify">Back when I was a newly-minted academic researcher, I had a line item in my start-up budget to pay a CS student to turn my idea for an iPhone app into reality. With the ability to pay a programmer $6K ($20/hour for 20 hours/week for 15 weeks), I thought students would be lining up at my door to claim this attractive stipend. What I learned, however, was that there were no students either at my institution or at neighboring ones that had the skills required to perform the task. When I spoke to an assistant dean about not being able to spend my startup funds, she actually put me in touch with her husband who worked at a NYC-based firm that developed medical software products, but there were no mechanisms in place for his company to contract their services to our academic institution.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Later on, after I had long since left academia, a LinkedIn connection who worked as an iOS app developer for a Silicon Valley startup confirmed that he taught himself the skills he uses in his job, and these skills typically are not taught in CS curricula at institutions similar to mine. At the time, I too was stretching my software coding muscles as a self-taught iOS app developer, and it was then that the seed for <a href="http://www.digitalhealthapplications.com">Digitalhealthapplications.com</a> was planted.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Based on the paradigm of the need I first identified when I was in academia, I started <a href="http://www.digitalhealthapplications.com">Digitalhealthapplications.com</a> to offer a means to create your iPhone app, from concept to App Store acceptance, in a rapid-turnaround timeframe (typically 5 weeks for a moderate-complexity app). My services are competitively priced, and my background in academic research allows me to support your evidence-based clinical research project in a collaborative, cost-effective, and timely manner.</p>
