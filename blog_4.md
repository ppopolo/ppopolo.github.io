			<h2>Making the Case For Your Custom-Built App</h2>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="prpl-row">

<p style="text-align:justify">Using custom apps built for your practice as a means to engage with your patients and clients on a more frequent basis is a great marketing tool, as well as a research tool for your evidence-based practice. Your reach as a “virtual” practitioner becomes far greater than ever possible through in-person office visits alone, by supplementing you practice with a smartphone app. Even before the pandemic, practitioner-patient interactions were limited to just a handful of times per year, if that, for a person free from chronic illness or medical conditions. More than providing care for their patients during times of illness, health practitioners can be influencers in helping their patients and clients lead more healthy lives. And a healthy lifestyle is cultivated through wellness-promoting behaviors and healthy habits, things that can be reinforced by multiple, frequent repetitions over time. That’s where a smartphone app custom-built for your medical practice and clientele comes in: by tapping into the device that most of us interact with continuously throughout the day every day, smartphone apps have the potential to not only monitor patient compliance with therapy requirements or recommendations, but to assist patients in modifying their behavior and encourage the formation of habits that will help them succeed in their therapy, or just live a more healthy life. And by tying the app to your particular practice through branding, you remain top-of-mind in your patients when they are healthy as well as when they are in need of yours services. What could be a better practitioner-patient relationship than that?
