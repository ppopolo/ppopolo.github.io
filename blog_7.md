<p style="text-align:justify">Watch my recent interview with “Conversations with Calvin: WE the SpecIEs” in which I discussed how smartphone apps support evidence-based clinical practice and help users develop healthy habits (and possibly save lives!), the marketing aspects of custom-built apps for health practitioners, and I even got to demo #strawvoice exercises (as advocated by my mentor Ingo Titze PhD) and talk about its amazing benefits for professional voice users like actors and singers. When talking about the marketing benefits to allied-health providers of having a custom-built app to give to their patients and clients to use on their smartphones, I pointed out that I think health providers today seek a more holistic approach to their practice. That is, the goal is to engage with their patients and clients not just when they come in for a specific malady or even once or twice a year for a physical or checkup, but rather to be a part of their patients’ daily life and to help promote wellness. When providers do this, they become “influencers,” influencing their  patients to lead a more healthy lifestyle. Do you agree?
