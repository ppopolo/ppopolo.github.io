<p>How a person uses their voice and their daily behaviors can impact the voice. With this app users can track several aspects of voice use and lifestyle on a daily basis. Regular tracking might help a person understand if certain voice uses or behaviors positively or negatively impact their voice.</p>

<p>This app can be used by individuals to track voice and daily behaviors for their own review. However, it is also intended to allow researchers the ability to look at large groups of people in terms of their voice use and daily behaviors to better understand factors that cause voice problems. For this purpose, the app sends your daily response log to a researcher at Michigan State University who compiles the data for scientific purposes.</p>
