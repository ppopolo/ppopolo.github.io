<p style="text-align:justify">Back when I was a newly-minted academic researcher, I had a line item in my start-up budget to pay a CS student to turn my idea for an iPhone app into reality. With the ability to pay a programmer $6K ($20/hour for 20 hours/week for 15 weeks), I thought students would be lining up at my door to claim this attractive stipend. What I learned, however, was that there were no students either at my institution or at neighboring ones that had the skills required to perform the task. When I spoke to an assistant dean about not being able to spend my startup funds, she actually put me in touch with her husband who worked at a NYC-based firm that developed medical software products to help me solve this problem, but there were no mechanisms in place for his company to contract their services to our academic institution in a cost-effective and timely manner.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Later on, after I had long since left academia, a LinkedIn connection who worked as an iOS app developer for a Silicon Valley startup confirmed that he taught himself the skills he uses in his job, and these skills typically are not taught in CS curricula at institutions similar to mine. At the time, I too was stretching my software coding muscles as a self-taught iOS app developer, and it was then that the seed for <a href="http://www.digitalhealthapplications.com">Digitalhealthapplications.com</a> was planted. Simply put, what I offer is the ability to create your iPhone app, from concept to App Store acceptance, in a rapid-turnaround timeframe, to support your allied health-related evidence-based clinical research project. Based on the paradigm of the need I first identified when I was in academia, I typically charge around $6000 to deliver your App-Store-published and downloadable app in just about 5 weeks, on average, for a low- to moderate-complexity app with up to six separate text-based or static-image user-interface screens (scenes) and basic features. Apps with more than 6 scenes, or that have animations and complicated graphic interfaces, advanced feature sets, or that implement complex algorithms or require significant computing or storage resources, are competitively priced upward from that basic starting point and require longer turnaround times.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As a product manager, software developer, and voice researcher, I bring a focused mix of industry, research, and academic experience and a strong set of transferable skills to the bioinstrumentation field and medical device industry. I have a history of product development and product management successes, from conceptual design through launch, in the areas of speech & voice acoustics, videolaryngoscopic imaging, and electronic health record (EHR) systems. I am highly skilled in Matlab programming for rapid prototyping and testing of complex algorithms, and I am a self-taught iOS app developer using Swiift to create iPhone apps that support evidence-based clinical practice. I am passionate about user experience/user interface (UX/UI) design and user research, and I am also an experienced university instructor (online & in-person) at the graduate and undergraduate levels. </p>
