<p style="text-align:justify">As a software developer and voice researcher, I bring a focused mix of industry, research, and academic experience to your evidence-based clinical research project. I have a history of product development successes, from conceptual design through launch, in the areas of speech & voice acoustics, videolaryngoscopic imaging, and electronic health record (EHR) systems. I am highly skilled in Matlab programming for rapid prototyping and testing of complex algorithms, and I am a self-taught iOS app developer using Swift to create iPhone apps that support evidence-based clinical practice. I am passionate about user experience/user interface (UX/UI) design and user research, and I am also an experienced university instructor (online & in-person) at the graduate and undergraduate levels. </p>
